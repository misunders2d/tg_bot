    - Send me a text message and I'll reply in text.
    - Send me a voice message and I will reply with voice.
    - Send me a picture (not a file) and I will describe the picture to the best of my knowledge. You can ask questions about that picture, too.
    - Forward me some other message and tell me what you want me to do with it.

    - Type /create followed by a prompt and I will try to create an image based on that prompt.
